## Warning: Do Not Use CoinJoin.io

The website CoinJoin.io is a scam, and will simply steal your BTC. (I made this warning site after losing some of my own.)

If you want to mix your BTC, look into the CoinJoin functionality built into [Samouri Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool) or [Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io/). But most of all, do your own research!

### Donate

If this site saved you from making the same mistake I did, consider donating a buck or two. (I legitimately am just trying to recoup a little of what I lost in my dumb mistake)
